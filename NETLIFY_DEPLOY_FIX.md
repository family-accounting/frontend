# 🔧 Netlify 404 Error - FIXED

## ❌ Original Error

```
Site not found
Looks like you followed a broken link or entered a URL that doesn't exist on Netlify.
```

---

## ✅ Problems Fixed

### 1. **Invalid Redirect Configuration**

**The Issue**: The `netlify.toml` file had an invalid `conditions` line that
broke SPA routing:

```toml
# ❌ WRONG - This causes 404 errors
[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
  force = false
  conditions = {Role = ["Not", "admin"]}  # ← Invalid!
```

**The Fix**: Simplified to standard SPA redirect:

```toml
# ✅ CORRECT - Simple SPA redirect
[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
```

### 2. **Conflicting Build Processing**

**The Issue**: Netlify's post-processing was conflicting with Vite's
optimizations.

**The Fix**: Disabled Netlify post-processing (Vite handles everything):

```toml
# ✅ CORRECT - Let Vite handle optimization
[build.processing]
  skip_processing = true
```

## 🚀 Deploy to Netlify

### Option 1: Git Push (Recommended)

If your site is connected to a Git repository:

```bash
# Commit the fixes
git add .
git commit -m "fix: netlify configuration for SPA routing"
git push
```

Netlify will automatically rebuild and deploy.

### Option 2: Manual Deploy via Netlify CLI

```bash
# Install Netlify CLI
npm install -g netlify-cli

# Login
netlify login

# Build locally
npm run build

# Deploy
netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist
```

### Option 3: Drag & Drop Deploy

1. Build locally: `npm run build`
2. Go to Netlify Dashboard
3. Drag the `dist` folder to the deploy area

---

## 🧪 Verify the Fix

### 1. Check Build Logs

In Netlify Dashboard:

1. Go to **Deploys** tab
2. Click on the latest deploy
3. Check the build log

**Expected Output**:

```
$ npm run build
✓ built in 25s
✓ dist folder created
Deploy successful!
```

### 2. Test the Site

Once deployed, test these URLs:

- ✅ `https://your-site.netlify.app/` → Should work
- ✅ `https://your-site.netlify.app/groups` → Should work (not 404)
- ✅ `https://your-site.netlify.app/auth/login` → Should work
- ✅ Direct refresh on any route → Should work

### 3. Check Response Headers

```bash
# Check if headers are applied
curl -I https://your-site.netlify.app/assets/js/vue-[hash].js

# Should include:
# Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable
```

## 📝 Complete Working `netlify.toml`

Your updated configuration should look like this:

```toml
# Build settings
[build]
  command = "npm run build"
  publish = "dist"

# Build performance
[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "20"
  NPM_FLAGS = "--legacy-peer-deps"

# Headers for performance optimization
[[headers]]
  for = "/*"
  [headers.values]
    X-Frame-Options = "DENY"
    X-Content-Type-Options = "nosniff"
    Referrer-Policy = "strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
    Cache-Control = "public, no-cache, must-revalidate"

[[headers]]
  for = "/assets/*"
  [headers.values]
    Cache-Control = "public, max-age=31536000, immutable"

[[headers]]
  for = "/*.js"
  [headers.values]
    Cache-Control = "public, max-age=31536000, immutable"
    Content-Type = "application/javascript; charset=utf-8"

[[headers]]
  for = "/*.css"
  [headers.values]
    Cache-Control = "public, max-age=31536000, immutable"
    Content-Type = "text/css; charset=utf-8"

[[headers]]
  for = "/*.woff2"
  [headers.values]
    Cache-Control = "public, max-age=31536000, immutable"
    Content-Type = "font/woff2"

[[headers]]
  for = "/*.png"
  [headers.values]
    Cache-Control = "public, max-age=31536000, immutable"

[[headers]]
  for = "/*.jpg"
  [headers.values]
    Cache-Control = "public, max-age=31536000, immutable"

[[headers]]
  for = "/*.svg"
  [headers.values]
    Cache-Control = "public, max-age=31536000, immutable"
    Content-Type = "image/svg+xml"

# SPA redirects - redirect all routes to index.html for client-side routing
[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200

# Disable Netlify's post-processing (Vite already handles minification/bundling)
[build.processing]
  skip_processing = true
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Still Getting 404?

#### 1. Clear Netlify Cache

In Netlify Dashboard:

- Go to **Site settings** → **Build & deploy** → **Environment**
- Click **Clear cache and retry deploy**

#### 2. Check Build Command

Ensure your Netlify site settings have:

- **Build command**: `npm run build`
- **Publish directory**: `dist`

#### 3. Check Node Version

Your `netlify.toml` specifies Node 20. If that fails, try:

```toml
[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "18"
```

#### 4. Verify dist Folder Contents

After building locally, check that `dist/` contains:

```
dist/
├── index.html          ← Must exist!
├── assets/
│   ├── js/
│   └── css/
└── ...
```

#### 5. Check for TypeScript Errors

If build fails:

```bash
# Check for TS errors
npm run build

# If you see errors, fix them first
# Or temporarily disable type checking:
# Change "build": "vue-tsc && vite build"
# To:     "build": "vite build"
```

---

## 🎯 Alternative: Minimal netlify.toml

If you still have issues, try this minimal configuration:

```toml
[build]
  command = "npm run build"
  publish = "dist"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
```

This ensures basic functionality. You can add optimizations later.
